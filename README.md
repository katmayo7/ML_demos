# ML Demos #

A collection of implementions for an assortment of machine learning and deep learning algorithms with basic overviews/explanations written using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). A list of implemented algorithms can be found below.

The purposes of these implementations is to emphasize familiarity with the built-in functions available in the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) libraries, so they only make use of the scikit-learn [built-in](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html).
