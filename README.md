# ML_practice

Demonstrations of implementing an assorted collection of machine learning algorithms, with basic overviews/explanations of the algorithms. Emphasis is on familiarity with functions, so currently only implemented on [built-in data sets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html).

Algorithms written in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), implemented with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

### Implmented: ###

* Regression.ipynb: linear and logistic regression
* naiveBayes.ipynb: Naive Bayes
* SVN.ipynb: support vector machine
* kNN.ipynb: k-nearest neighbors
* Trees.ipynb: decision tree and random forest
* Clustering.ipynb: k-Means and DBScan
